    SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) thread function.
    This function initializes and runs a SLAM algorithm using LIDAR data. It subscribes to LIDAR scan messages,
    processes the scans, updates the SLAM algorithm, and publishes the resulting map and robot position.
    
    Args:
        setupBarrier (Barrier): A barrier to synchronize the setup of the SLAM algorithm.
        readyBarrier (Barrier): A barrier to synchronize the readiness of the SLAM thread.

    The function performs the following steps:
    1. Initializes the SLAM algorithm with specified parameters.
    2. Subscribes to the "lidar/scan" topic to receive LIDAR scan data.
    3. Waits for all threads to be ready if a readyBarrier is provided.
    4. Enters a loop where it:
        - Retrieves the latest LIDAR scan message.
        - Processes the scan data (resampling and filtering).
        - Updates the SLAM algorithm with the processed scan data.
        - Retrieves the current robot position and map.
        - Publishes the map and robot position to the "slam/mappose" topic.
    5. Gracefully exits the thread when the execution context signals an exit.
    
    Note:
        - The function assumes the existence of several helper functions and classes such as `getCurrentExecutionContext`,
          `RMHC_SLAM`, `Laser`, `subscribe`, `getMessages`, `PubSubMsg`, `resampleLidarScan`, and `publish`.
        - The function uses a blocking call to `getMessages` with a timeout of 1 second to retrieve LIDAR scan messages.
        - The SLAM algorithm is updated only if the number of valid distance measurements exceeds `MIN_SAMPLES_FOR_SLAM_UPDATE`.
        - If the current scan is inadequate, the previous scan data is used to update the SLAM algorithm.
