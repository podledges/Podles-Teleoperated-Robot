    Thread function to handle receiving data over a TLS connection in a loop until the context signals an exit.

        readyBarrier (Barrier, optional): A threading barrier to synchronize the start of the thread.
                                           If provided, the thread will wait for all parties to be ready before proceeding.
    The function performs the following steps:
    1. Sets up the execution context.
    2. Waits for all threads to be ready if a barrier is provided.
    3. Sets up the TLS server to accept incoming connections.
    4. Enters a loop to receive data over the TLS connection until the context signals an exit.
    5. Processes received messages and dispatches them accordingly.
    6. Gracefully shuts down the TLS server and disconnects the connection.
